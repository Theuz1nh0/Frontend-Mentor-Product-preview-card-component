## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:opsz,wght@9..144,100;9..144,400;9..144,500;9..144,700&family=Montserrat:wght@100;500;700&display=swap');
```
```css
body {
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #f2ebe3;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to continue studying about responsive web design and flexbox, as well as delving deeper into html and css

### Useful resources

- [Text fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me put the necessary fonts for my project.
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to position my html elements in a practical and fast way. Recommend if you want to learn a little about flexbox.
