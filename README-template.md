## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:opsz,wght@9..144,100;9..144,400;9..144,500;9..144,700&family=Montserrat:wght@100;500;700&display=swap');
```
```css
body {
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #f2ebe3;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to continue studying about responsive web design and flexbox, as well as delving deeper into html and css

### Useful resources

- [Text fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me put the necessary fonts for my project.
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to position my html elements in a practical and fast way. Recommend if you want to learn a little about flexbox.
